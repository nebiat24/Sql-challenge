Module 9 - SQL challenge

Description
This contains my submission for module 9. We were tasked with finding 8 slections of data for Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). that had not yet ported its database from .csv files to a true database.

I developed an ERD using Lucidchart for the database, imported the tables, and wrote the queries, which can be found in this repo.

Requirements
 to run .sql files and import .csv files into tables. I used PGAdmin4.
